# *iLearnPlus*: a comprehensive and automated machine-learning platform for nucleic acid and protein sequence analysis, prediction and visualization. 
*iLearnPlus* is the first machine-learning platform with both graphical- and web-based user interface that enables the construction of automated machine-learning pipelines for computational analysis and predictions using nucleic acid and protein sequences.

# Installation

  - Download *iLearnPlus* by 
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/Superzchen/iFeature
  ```
  *iLearnPlus* is an open-source Python-based toolkit, which operates in the Python environment (Python version 3.6 or above) and can run on multiple operating systems (such as Windows, Mac and Linux). Prior to installing and running *iLearnPlus*, all the dependencies should be installed in the Python environment, including sys, os, re, PyQt5, qdarkstyle, numpy (1.18.5), pandas (1.0.5), threading, sip, datetime, platform, pickle, copy, scikit-learn (0.23.1), math, scipy (1.5.0), collections, itertools, torch (≥1.3.1), lightgbm (2.3.1), xgboost (1.0.2), matplotlib (3.1.1), seaborn,  joblib, warnings, random, multiprocessing and time. In addition, the Qt GUI framework must be installed in your machine and configured correctly. **For convenience, we strongly recommended users to install the Anaconda Python environment (The Qt GUI framework is built in) in your local computer. The software can be freely downloaded from https://www.anaconda.com/.**
